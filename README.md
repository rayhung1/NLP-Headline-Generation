# DATASCI 266: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning 
## UC Berkeley School for Information
## Final Project 

This repository houses the collaborative project work of Dipika Kumar, Jack Forlines, and Raymond Hung. 
It encompasses the components and supporting materials developed as part of our collaborative effort, which is focused on addressing the key challenges involved in fine-tuning large language models (LLMS) for generating headlines from social media text. Within this repository, you'll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks, datasets, code implementations, and documentation that reflect our collective efforts in tackling key research questions, experimenting with different methodologies, and deriving insightful conclusions.


### Abstract
#### Generating Effective Headlines for Social Media Posts
This study utilizes pre-trained LLMs to generate headlines from social media posts, emphasizing accuracy and engagement. By employing models like PEGASUS, T5, and BART on Reddit data, we aim to preserve semantic content while enhancing summarization. Evaluation metrics, including ROUGE, BLEU, and semantic similarity scores, alongside human feedback, highlight the T5 model's superior performance. Despite computational constraints and model-specific challenges, our research underscores the importance of innovative approaches to evaluation of headline generation from user-generated content.
