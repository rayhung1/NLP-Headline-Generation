directly in the model should i be exploring the relationship between each possible predictor and the outcome variable to establish a relationship first before building my model for example via running a chisquare of independence test on a potential categorical predictor and my outcome variable or is this redundant as the logistic regression model will sus out the nonsignificant predictors tldr what are the best practices for feature selection in logistic regression should i do exploratory data analysis for every possible predictor before building my model to rationalize their inclusion in the

i begin that i am coming from the hard science sphere and am trying to integrate some novel data science so some of the things i talk about might make no sense please ask questions i have a database of variables that are collected continuously over time this database is essentially measuring the conditions of the interplanetary magnetic field too complex to model which drives numerous phenomena that occur in the earth is atmosphere etc these phenomena are of interest to researchers but only occur ever so often to find these you have to manually search years and years of data something that is simply not too practical i want to develop some sort of method to take a number of instances of a phenomenon and search the continuous database for more instances i think that this needs to be split into two tasks discover common patterns dips spikes sign changes or even more complex shapes between the inputted instances it will also have to discern the variables of interest because not all in the database will drive a single phenomenon moreover if the program can then output these relationships such as variables appear to drive the phenomenon this will be of interest to users use these relationships to search the continuous stream for more instances like i mentioned i am not very experienced in data science of course i am not asking anyone here to develop this for me or anything but

brains and decreased cognitive capacity and for the sake of this example i will input variables average frequency of consumption and quantity consumed i will take this through a python script and i will output a mathematical function that connects two percentages the probability first percentage x that you will be y less capable than the average nonsmoker person in either shortterm memory attention span etc the problem is i know literally no statistics so i am kinda struggling with the math side is this what you would call a linear regression what is the actual algorithm for outputting this mathematical function i first thought i would have to just do some sort of arithmetic mean but it got more complicated when you had more values for example i can have this data set a bigger sample would give more accuracy but i am gonna give a sample of so this example is easier let f be the average frequency of use in days how much days do they wait in between smoke sessions let q be the average quantity they consume in each session in grams or whatever unit of measure does not matter user f q user f q user f q each user will also have a variable representing how much less capable they are than the average person on a certain mental task in reality i am probably gonna have a list of variables for each user so i compute a separate mathematical function for each mental ability memory attention span etc but for the sake of this example let is say they have just one more variable representing how worse they are from the average person at attention span let it be a user a user a user a now i have to use all this data to compute a mathematical function f s gt s f q p f q are from r p is from which takes in the percentage of probability that the output is gonna happen as well as f and q and outputs the percentage decrease in attention span from the normal person basically a now that i think of it it should work in reverse too inputting the percentage decrease and outputting the probability that will happen so this function also has to be bijective actually it is not bijective per se because i just reverse a and p i add a in the domain set s and take out p in the output anyway now what i need help with is computing the larger function that takes in two variables and outputs the function f and that larger function is fed before two lists of variables to have the proper data that will be the script i will write i am stumped because it is taking in three lists of variables and outputs if it was just two outputting it would be easier for example user f a user f a user f a it is way easier to do it now having to output just a if i input or i know what i am going to get if i output anything else between and i just have to find out the relation between the two closest variables from to f halved and a tripled this would mean that most likely if f quarters then a would be multiplied by if f is divided by a would be multiplied by etc that is for any variable between and between and i do the same with the other data is this a correct approach either way if you also have to add the output p besides the output a i am stuck then you also add the input q and i am even more stuck so what do i have to do i know how to compute derivatives and to work with matrices and determinants in case that is needed', 'title': 'how do i compute this

mahalanobis distance matching however i keep getting the following warning on matlab warning matrix is close to singular or badly scaled results may be inaccurate rcond e the warning was caused because the determinant of my covariance matrix was very close to so when i calculated the inverse of this matrix as i need to do for finding the mahalanobis distance the matrix element values become very close to as well after reading about this warning a little bit i found that when this warning is displayed the results of mahalanobis distance matching is not very reliable i thought this was because my matrix became very sparse after i introduced onehotencoding to split the multicategorical features into many different features and hence some of my new features were for category values that had very few occurrences less than to address this issue i got rid of the category values with very low occurrences less than or binned them together with other lowoccurrence category values into slightly larger bins so their chances of occurring increased and my datamatrix was less sparse so i reduced the number of features from to and i plotted the histograms for all my features to see their distributions and this is what it looked like note that the element values have been normalized to by subtracting the feature mean and then divided by the feature standard deviation it looked visually satisfactory to me but i still kept getting the same warning in matlab when i tried finding the determinant of my new covariance matrix it was still very small e in a further attempt to fix this issue i checked whether removing all of the categorical features if we consider the onehot encoded features made things any better by making the matrix less sparse the new featurehistogram looked like this this time when i tried mahalanobis distance matching the warning was removed because the determinant of the covariance matrix was larger e so i tried to see if i could include one of the removed multicategorical features without facing the same problem as these are important features i would prefer to include when doing my matching i added a categorical feature with possible values and all the values very well distributed see histogram below but alas simply including these new onehotencoded features seems to cause the determinant of the covariance matrix to become so small that i start getting the same warning in matlab is there any fix to this issue or is it simply impossible to reliably perform mahalanobis distance matching on this dataset without leaving out the multicategorical
