autoencoders to try to create a new representation of my data in a smaller dimension the problem is no matter how big i have tried some configuration of networks my network is my autoencoder cannot

validation accuracy but i could not do this i would like to know what am i doing wrong or if there are any tips that you could give me to make it work better describing my dataset my dataset is about movies some of its features are things like budget launching year launching month imdb rating etc these are features that are not binary i think there are to features like this the rest of the features are just binary features like if the movie is an action movie or a horror movie there are many features like this as many as of them so you can visualize it as something like this imdbid imdb rating budget horror action other feature tt one of the issues is that i do not have many training examples but this should be a problem for generalizing it not to overfit it i think this data is being normalized using sklearn is minmaxscaler to put all features between and describing my network i have tried many versions of this network but it is a feedforward neural network that receives data pass the data to a smaller layer and then comes back to a layer the same size as the number of features of my dataset it is something like this gt gt gt gt i have tried many versions of this some shallower others deeper some more complex other simpler most of these networks i obtain an accuracy of i notice that my loss keeps going down but my accuracy does not increase every time i am using

it will not ever reach unless it makes incremental progress on the way there and more importantly i would like it to maximize the score as an end goal see how far it can go i could train it to reach

classification to begin with and simply predict the final score instead of a value it would be anywhere on the interval my question is whether using the neural network to approximate the score in this way is something that is normally done or if there are inherent problems with it the other approach i was thinking about was training the neural network to take in two games and predict which one will score higher this would be the sort of classic classification problem neural networks are known for but it seems a bit less natural for example if one game loses then the other game would just say i

be y less capable than the average nonsmoker person in either shortterm memory attention span etc the problem is i know literally no statistics so i am kinda struggling with the math side is this what you would call a linear regression what is the actual algorithm for outputting this mathematical function i first thought i would have to just do some sort of arithmetic mean but it got more complicated when you had more values for example i can have this data set a bigger sample would give more accuracy but i am gonna give a sample of so this example is easier let f be the average frequency of use in days how much days do they wait in between smoke sessions let q be the average quantity they consume in each session in grams or whatever unit of measure does not matter user f q user f q user f q each user will also have a variable representing how much less capable they are than the average person on a certain mental task in reality i am probably gonna have a list of variables for each user so i compute a separate mathematical function for each mental ability memory attention span etc but for the sake of this example let is say they have just one more variable representing how worse they are from the average person at attention span let it be a user a user a user a now i have to use all this data to compute a mathematical function f s gt s f q p f q are from r p is from which takes in the percentage of probability that the output is gonna happen as well as f and q and outputs the percentage decrease in attention span from the normal person basically a now that i think of it it should work in reverse too inputting the percentage decrease and outputting the probability that will happen so this function also has to be bijective actually it is not bijective per se because i just reverse a and p i add a in the domain set s and take out p in the output anyway now what i need help with is computing the larger function that takes in two variables and outputs the function f and that larger function is fed before two lists of variables to have the proper data that will be the script i will write i am stumped because it is taking in three lists

going to get if i output anything else between and i just have to find out the relation between the two closest variables from to f halved and a tripled this would mean that most likely if f quarters

because the determinant of my covariance matrix was very close to so when i calculated the inverse of this matrix as i need to do for finding the mahalanobis distance the matrix element values become very close to as well after reading about this warning a little bit i found that when this warning is displayed the results of mahalanobis distance matching is not very reliable i thought this was because my matrix became very sparse after i introduced onehotencoding to split the multicategorical features into many different features and hence some of my new features were for category values that had very few occurrences less than to address this issue i got rid of the category values with very low occurrences less than or binned them together with other lowoccurrence category values into slightly larger bins so their chances of occurring increased and my datamatrix was less sparse so i reduced the number of features from to and i plotted the histograms for all my features to see their distributions and this is what it looked like note that the element values have been normalized to by subtracting the feature mean and then divided by the feature standard deviation it looked visually satisfactory to me but i still kept getting the same warning in matlab when i tried finding the determinant of my new covariance matrix it was still very small e in a further attempt to fix this issue i checked whether removing all of the categorical features if we consider the onehot encoded features made things any better by making the matrix less sparse the new featurehistogram looked like this this time when i tried mahalanobis distance matching the warning was removed because the determinant of the covariance matrix was larger e so i tried to see if i could include one of the removed multicategorical features without facing the same problem as these are important features i would prefer to include when doing my matching i added a categorical feature with possible values and all the values very well distributed see histogram below but alas simply including these new onehotencoded features seems to cause the determinant of the covariance matrix to become so small that i start

year now and i know some sql a bit of r and i have completed some small projects using data science data engineering practices i also know how to work in excel but i do not really have experience using databases i am totally willing to make the time and money investment in something like a bootcamp and i have the means to do fulltime training but i do not want to do this if there is a better faster way to get into the industry what i really want to know is what can i do that will get me a job in the field asap is there some specific bootcamp that will make this happen if so what are the best bootcamps or some particular tech skill i could learn that would basically guarantee that i am hireable very soon if i something like learned microsoft sql server or tableau and given my other skills would this be likely to get me hired i have been looking into bootcamps like thinkful springboard and data application lab the concern i have about these is actually that i already know a lot of the stuff they teach and i am worried that these will be a waste of time and not elevate me to where i want to be i also worry about it taking months to complete these programs as they estimate i would like to be finished in no more than about months thoughts   \n","1

there are options to smooth binned data layered linear on bin linear on avg linear on log avg and variable gradient are these methods commonly used in any algorithms i am not sure how i would implement it into r ampxb variable gradient is the most confusing it groups data from neighboring bins with a bin factor being determined the level of smoothing is determined by the radius all bins contribute to the calculation of the bin factor with decreasing weight as the distance from the target bin increases the weight is equal to radius distance radius ampxb once you calculate the overall factor a calculation is performed for each bin weighted by an exposure with various radii and a selected credibility level the calculation that yields the largest distance from is then selected as the factor to be used for that bin ampxb over multiple iterations of the model the factors are blended until the model converges and we receive a final coefficient for that bin ampxb since it is a program i have no clue what is going on in the background to calculate the convergence or what type of model this is it ends up being a multiplicative model so i am guessing it is a log linked glm   \n","3

                                               let is say i have created a fraud detection model i already have a process that cleans the data and stores the trainable data in a table in a database and now i want to set up a recurring job that retrains my model every x time period how do people go about this when we want to retrain the model does not that data have to be loaded into the environment that the new model is going to be retrained i guess i am confused at how exactly the model takes the data from the database and starts training on it do people use spark to load it into the environment with the modeltobe then start the retraining process does not that mean that the retraining environment has to have enough space to cover that data being brought in apologies if this has already been asked but i have not seen a clear answer from this subredditfrom what i have found on google thanks so much for any assistance   \n","4  i am working with a dataset of patient performancedata and patient demographics for people with a medical condition i am trying to assess the effect of a treatment on the patients and as i am trying to replicate a randomized experiment from a observational study i am performing matching between the treatment and control group when i try to perform mahalanobis distance matching however i keep getting the following warning on matlab warning matrix is close to singular or badly scaled results may be inaccurate rcond e the warning was caused because the determinant of my covariance matrix was very close to so when i calculated the inverse of this matrix as i need to do for finding the mahalanobis distance the matrix element values become very close to as well after reading about this warning a little bit i found that when this warning is displayed the results of mahalanobis distance matching is not very reliable i thought this was because my matrix became very sparse after i introduced onehotencoding to split the multicategorical features into many different features and hence some of my new features were for category values that had very few occurrences less than to address this issue i got rid of the category values with very low occurrences less than or binned them together with other lowoccurrence category values into slightly larger bins so their chances of occurring increased and my datamatrix was less sparse so i reduced the number of features from to and i plotted the histograms for all my features to see their distributions and this is what it looked like note that the element values have been normalized to by subtracting the feature mean and then divided by the feature standard deviation it looked visually satisfactory to me but i still kept getting the same warning in matlab when i tried finding the determinant of my new covariance matrix it was still very small e in a further attempt to fix this issue i checked whether removing all of the categorical features if we consider the onehot encoded features made things any better by making the matrix less sparse the new featurehistogram looked like this this time when i tried mahalanobis distance matching the warning was removed because the determinant of the covariance matrix was larger e so i tried to see if i could include one of the removed multicategorical features without facing the same problem as these are important features i would prefer to include when doing my matching i added a categorical feature with possible values and all the values very well distributed see histogram below but alas simply including these new onehotencoded features seems to cause the determinant of the covariance matrix to become so small that i start getting the same warning in matlab is there any fix to this issue or is it simply impossible to reliably perform mahalanobis distance matching on this dataset without leaving out the multicategorical values   \n","\n","
