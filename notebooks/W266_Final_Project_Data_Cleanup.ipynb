              "5   I'm cross posting this from /r/cyberlaw, hopefully you guys find it as interesting as I did(it deals with Google Analytics):\\n\\nSo quite awhile ago, I ordered a Papa John's pizza online. My job largely involves looking at ads that appear online, so afterwards I was quick to notice *I was getting a LOT* of Papa Johns ads (especially at night) being served through a Google owned company (DoubleClick media). Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. \\n\\nFor those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google's analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.\\n\\nSo let's break it apart: \\n\\n&gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing\\n\\nFirst off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick's redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.\\n\\n* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**\\n\\n* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.\\n\\n* \"GoogleRemarketing\", huh? Let's take a look at the definition for \"Remarketing\"\\n\\n&gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.\\n\\nWhile in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nJust thought I'd put this out there. I'm sure it's not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale. \\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPS: I did a quick survey across several thousand domains, and for the record: right now, the most common external resource locations on the internet are(Google owned is bolded):\\n\\n**www.google-analytics.com**\\n\\n**pagead2.googlesyndication.com**\\n\\n**googleads.g.doubleclick.net**\\n\\nedge.quantserve.com\\n\\n**ad.doubleclick.net**\\n\\n**www.youtube.com**\\n\\nb.scorecardresearch.com\\n\\ns0.2mdn.net\\n\\ndg.specificclick.net\\n\\nview.atdmt.com\\n\\n**www.google.com**\\n\\n**ajax.googleapis.com**\\n\\n**partner.googleadservices.com**\\n\\nThat's a lot of data.  \n",

              "      <td>I'm cross posting this from /r/cyberlaw, hopefully you guys find it as interesting as I did(it deals with Google Analytics):\\n\\nSo quite awhile ago, I ordered a Papa John's pizza online. My job largely involves looking at ads that appear online, so afterwards I was quick to notice *I was getting a LOT* of Papa Johns ads (especially at night) being served through a Google owned company (DoubleClick media). Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. \\n\\nFor those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google's analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.\\n\\nSo let's break it apart: \\n\\n&amp;gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing\\n\\nFirst off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick's redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.\\n\\n* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**\\n\\n* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.\\n\\n* \"GoogleRemarketing\", huh? Let's take a look at the definition for \"Remarketing\"\\n\\n&amp;gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.\\n\\nWhile in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nJust thought I'd put this out there. I'm sure it's not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale. \\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPS: I did a quick survey across several thousand domains, and for the record: right now, the most common external resource locations on the internet are(Google owned is bolded):\\n\\n**www.google-analytics.com**\\n\\n**pagead2.googlesyndication.com**\\n\\n**googleads.g.doubleclick.net**\\n\\nedge.quantserve.com\\n\\n**ad.doubleclick.net**\\n\\n**www.youtube.com**\\n\\nb.scorecardresearch.com\\n\\ns0.2mdn.net\\n\\ndg.specificclick.net\\n\\nview.atdmt.com\\n\\n**www.google.com**\\n\\n**ajax.googleapis.com**\\n\\n**partner.googleadservices.com**\\n\\nThat's a lot of data.</td>\n",

              "5   I'm cross posting this from /r/cyberlaw, hopefully you guys find it as interesting as I did(it deals with Google Analytics):\\n\\nSo quite awhile ago, I ordered a Papa John's pizza online. My job largely involves looking at ads that appear online, so afterwards I was quick to notice *I was getting a LOT* of Papa Johns ads (especially at night) being served through a Google owned company (DoubleClick media). Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. \\n\\nFor those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google's analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.\\n\\nSo let's break it apart: \\n\\n&gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing\\n\\nFirst off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick's redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.\\n\\n* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**\\n\\n* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.\\n\\n* \"GoogleRemarketing\", huh? Let's take a look at the definition for \"Remarketing\"\\n\\n&gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.\\n\\nWhile in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nJust thought I'd put this out there. I'm sure it's not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale. \\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPS: I did a quick survey across several thousand domains, and for the record: right now, the most common external resource locations on the internet are(Google owned is bolded):\\n\\n**www.google-analytics.com**\\n\\n**pagead2.googlesyndication.com**\\n\\n**googleads.g.doubleclick.net**\\n\\nedge.quantserve.com\\n\\n**ad.doubleclick.net**\\n\\n**www.youtube.com**\\n\\nb.scorecardresearch.com\\n\\ns0.2mdn.net\\n\\ndg.specificclick.net\\n\\nview.atdmt.com\\n\\n**www.google.com**\\n\\n**ajax.googleapis.com**\\n\\n**partner.googleadservices.com**\\n\\nThat's a lot of data.  \n",

              "      <td>I'm cross posting this from /r/cyberlaw, hopefully you guys find it as interesting as I did(it deals with Google Analytics):\\n\\nSo quite awhile ago, I ordered a Papa John's pizza online. My job largely involves looking at ads that appear online, so afterwards I was quick to notice *I was getting a LOT* of Papa Johns ads (especially at night) being served through a Google owned company (DoubleClick media). Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. \\n\\nFor those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google's analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.\\n\\nSo let's break it apart: \\n\\n&amp;gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing\\n\\nFirst off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick's redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.\\n\\n* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**\\n\\n* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.\\n\\n* \"GoogleRemarketing\", huh? Let's take a look at the definition for \"Remarketing\"\\n\\n&amp;gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.\\n\\nWhile in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nJust thought I'd put this out there. I'm sure it's not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale. \\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPS: I did a quick survey across several thousand domains, and for the record: right now, the most common external resource locations on the internet are(Google owned is bolded):\\n\\n**www.google-analytics.com**\\n\\n**pagead2.googlesyndication.com**\\n\\n**googleads.g.doubleclick.net**\\n\\nedge.quantserve.com\\n\\n**ad.doubleclick.net**\\n\\n**www.youtube.com**\\n\\nb.scorecardresearch.com\\n\\ns0.2mdn.net\\n\\ndg.specificclick.net\\n\\nview.atdmt.com\\n\\n**www.google.com**\\n\\n**ajax.googleapis.com**\\n\\n**partner.googleadservices.com**\\n\\nThat's a lot of data.</td>\n",

My job largely involves looking at ads that appear online, so afterwards I was quick to notice *I was getting a LOT* of Papa Johns ads (especially at night) being served through a Google owned company (DoubleClick media). Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. \\n\\nFor those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google's analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.\\n\\nSo let's break it apart: \\n\\n&gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing\\n\\nFirst off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick's redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.\\n\\n* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**\\n\\n* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.\\n\\n* \\\"GoogleRemarketing\\\", huh? Let's take a look at the definition for \\\"Remarketing\\\"\\n\\n&gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.\\n\\nWhile in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nJust thought I'd put this out there. I'm sure it's not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale. \\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPS: I did a quick survey across several thousand domains, and for the record: right now, the most common external resource locations on the internet are(Google owned is bolded):\\n\\n**www.google-analytics.com**\\n\\n**pagead2.googlesyndication.com**\\n\\n**googleads.g.doubleclick.net**\\n\\nedge.quantserve.com\\n\\n**ad.doubleclick.net**\\n\\n**www.youtube.com**\\n\\nb.scorecardresearch.com\\n\\ns0.2mdn.net\\n\\ndg.specificclick.net\\n\\nview.atdmt.com\\n\\n**www.google.com**\\n\\n**ajax.googleapis.com**\\n\\n**partner.googleadservices.com**\\n\\nThat's a lot of data.\",\n          \"i decided grad school (physics) was not for me and i am branching out into the job market.  a web analytics place is interested in me (and i'm interested in any kind of data analysis).  \\\"The exercise is to use a comparison of three or more months of data to prepare a 5 to 10 slide PowerPoint presentation of any significant information about site visitors, what they are doing, how they arrive at our site that we could use to improve site performance as an acquisition source.\\\"  he said i should 'tell a story'.  this is a field i am unfamiliar with so i'm looking for any basic tips, common pitfalls, and expectations.  thanks.

Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. \\n\\nFor those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google is analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.\\n\\nSo let is break it apart: \\n\\n&gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing\\n\\nFirst off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick is redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.\\n\\n* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**\\n\\n* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.\\n\\n* \"GoogleRemarketing\", huh? Let is take a look at the definition for \"Remarketing\"\\n\\n&gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.\\n\\nWhile in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nJust thought I would put this out there. I am sure it is not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale. \\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPS: I did a quick survey across several thousand domains, and for the record: right now, the most common external resource locations on the internet are(Google owned is bolded):\\n\\n**www.google-analytics.com**\\n\\n**pagead2.googlesyndication.com**\\n\\n**googleads.g.doubleclick.net**\\n\\nedge.quantserve.com\\n\\n**ad.doubleclick.net**\\n\\n**www.youtube.com**\\n\\nb.scorecardresearch.com\\n\\ns0.2mdn.net\\n\\ndg.specificclick.net\\n\\nview.atdmt.com\\n\\n**www.google.com**\\n\\n**ajax.googleapis.com**\\n\\n**partner.googleadservices.com**\\n\\nThat is a lot of data.  \n",

              "      <td>I am cross posting this from /r/cyberlaw, hopefully you guys find it as interesting as I did(it deals with Google Analytics):\\n\\nSo quite awhile ago, I ordered a Papa John is pizza online. My job largely involves looking at ads that appear online, so afterwards I was quick to notice *I was getting a LOT* of Papa Johns ads (especially at night) being served through a Google owned company (DoubleClick media). Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. \\n\\nFor those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google is analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.\\n\\nSo let is break it apart: \\n\\n&amp;gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing\\n\\nFirst off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick is redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.\\n\\n* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**\\n\\n* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.\\n\\n* \"GoogleRemarketing\", huh? Let is take a look at the definition for \"Remarketing\"\\n\\n&amp;gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.\\n\\nWhile in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nJust thought I would put this out there. I am sure it is not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale. \\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPS: I did a quick survey across several thousand domains, and for the record: right now, the most common external resource locations on the internet are(Google owned is bolded):\\n\\n**www.google-analytics.com**\\n\\n**pagead2.googlesyndication.com**\\n\\n**googleads.g.doubleclick.net**\\n\\nedge.quantserve.com\\n\\n**ad.doubleclick.net**\\n\\n**www.youtube.com**\\n\\nb.scorecardresearch.com\\n\\ns0.2mdn.net\\n\\ndg.specificclick.net\\n\\nview.atdmt.com\\n\\n**www.google.com**\\n\\n**ajax.googleapis.com**\\n\\n**partner.googleadservices.com**\\n\\nThat is a lot of data.</td>\n",

My job largely involves looking at ads that appear online, so afterwards I was quick to notice *I was getting a LOT* of Papa Johns ads (especially at night) being served through a Google owned company (DoubleClick media). Yesterday one of these ads popped up again on Youtube (a place that typically serves using the adwords program, not doubleclick), so I decided to copy the URL. \\n\\nFor those not in the advertising field: Making full use of Google is analytics tool means that certain information about the advertising campaign is leaked in the URL.\\n\\nSo let is break it apart: \\n\\n&gt;http://ad.doubleclick.net/click;h=(junk here);~sscs=?http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=(junk here)&amp;adurl=http://www.papajohns.com/index.shtm?utm_source=googlenetwork&amp;utm_medium=DisplayCPC&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleRemarketing\\n\\nFirst off, we see ~sscs: ~sscs is doubleclick is redirect variable. So rather than directly serving adwords ads, they overrode it to serve through doubleclick, then redirect through what would otherwise be an adwords link(http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net). This is tighter integration than is generally seen with adwords/doubleclick.\\n\\n* The interesting part is the end variables utm_source=**googlenetwork**&amp;utm_medium=**DisplayCPC**&amp;utm_campaign=**GoogleRemarketing**\\n\\n* DisplayCPC/googlenetwork - Confirmation that doubleclick is now more finely integrated with adwords.\\n\\n* \\\"GoogleRemarketing\\\", huh? Let is take a look at the definition for \\\"Remarketing\\\"\\n\\n&gt;Using past campaign information to target a particular message to an audience.\\n\\nWhile in the past behavioral targetting has largely been based on the sum of your use, this is an interesting(though no doubt more widespread than is known) change in that; explicitly targeting old customers though a *massive* network of sites.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nJust thought I would put this out there. I am sure it is not new to a lot of people, but at least to me it was interesting to see concepts like this actually put into practice on such a large scale. \\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPS: I did a quick survey across several thousand domains, and for the record: right now, the most common external resource locations on the internet are(Google owned is bolded):\\n\\n**www.google-analytics.com**\\n\\n**pagead2.googlesyndication.com**\\n\\n**googleads.g.doubleclick.net**\\n\\nedge.quantserve.com\\n\\n**ad.doubleclick.net**\\n\\n**www.youtube.com**\\n\\nb.scorecardresearch.com\\n\\ns0.2mdn.net\\n\\ndg.specificclick.net\\n\\nview.atdmt.com\\n\\n**www.google.com**\\n\\n**ajax.googleapis.com**\\n\\n**partner.googleadservices.com**\\n\\nThat is a lot of data.\",\n          \"i decided grad school (physics) was not for me and i am branching out into the job market.  a web analytics place is interested in me (and i am interested in any kind of data analysis).  \\\"The exercise is to use a comparison of three or more months of data to prepare a 5 to 10 slide PowerPoint presentation of any significant information about site visitors, what they are doing, how they arrive at our site that we could use to improve site performance as an acquisition source.\\\"  he said i should  notell a story.  this is a field i am unfamiliar with so i am looking for any basic tips, common pitfalls, and expectations.  thanks.
